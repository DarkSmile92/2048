# 2048
2048 Game originally from Gabriele Cirulli.

This repository will grow over time and the goal is to develop a 2048 game in addition with AI.
The AI should predict the best next move.

## Rules
Copied from Wikipedia:
> 2048 is played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.[9] Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.[2] Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.[16][19] The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow.

There is an android app which does not end when the player reaches a tile with 2048. It can continue until infinity.
This app should also not stop on 2048.
